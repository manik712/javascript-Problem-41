//You can think of character classes as characters with special meaning.
// They are recognized as special when you place the \ before the character.

// Here is a list of the character classes in JavaScript:

// ., \cX, \d, \D, \f, \n, \r, \s, \S, \t, \v, \w, \W, \0, \xhh, \uhhhh, \uhhhhh, [\b]

// There is a hidden word in this string:

// const str = "*^&$Regular#$%Expressions$%$$%^*"

// Write the regular expression that reveals the hidden word. You have to remove all of the special characters to reveal the word. Use the character class \w in your expression.

// Notes
// Check the Resources tab for details on character classes if you're stuck.
function removeSpecial(str) {
  return str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, " ");
}
console.log(removeSpecial("*^&$Regular#$%Expressions$%$$%^*"));
